\subsection{Detailed Description}
This program is an example of threading in Java. It\textquotesingle{}s called \char`\"{}\+The wolf and the rabbits\char`\"{}, and it creates separate threads to implement a simple simulation\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \hyperlink{class_wolf}{Wolf} is the hunter. It\textquotesingle{}s solely existence purpose is to hunt, and eventually eat, rabbits. After the wolf eats a rabbit, it has to take a little siesta, which lasts for about 5 cycles of entities movements. (One cycle = every entity -\/ rabbits and the wolf -\/ attempted to move to one, adjacent area). The wolf always hunts the closest rabbit, and after all the rabbits are eaten, he can finally go to the eternal sleep.
\item Rabbits are the prey. They try to run away from the wolf. Unfortunately, rabbits are neither as crafty nor as smart as the wolf \+:(. When they meet the fence (window boundary) they are getting confused. They can behave like a fly next to a window, still trying to go through the fence even though it\textquotesingle{}s impossible, but they can even start moving towards the hunter. Poor little beings... \begin{DoxyAuthor}{Author}
